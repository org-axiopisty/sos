## wat?

I sent my friend an idea for how you could use the POTS telephone service using to turn phone numbers into API endpoints operated by TTS/STS engines operated by AI agents. She's very encouraging and didn't mock me :whew: but she did point out that I am fond of coming up with solutions to problems nobody has.

YET.

How about a one-liner for preserving a forensic image of an APFS filesystem snapshot to an attached iPhone? 

Using an AI to make an announcement for transmission via a connected radio via TTS so the users of your household radio system know you've arrived back at the house? 

Removing unnecessary commentary from a git repository?
## Vault Local Customs

No reliance on a third-party extension or plugin must exist for the contents of this vault to be understood by a human.

### Formats and encoding 

Formatted documents should use markdown, which is easily understood by humans and machines. 

Character sets and encodings for the contents of this vault should be friendly and permitted and not cause problems for readers and contributors on APFS, NTFS, or advanced filesystems like zfs and btrfs. e.g. filenames and directories can't contain a `:`, and avoid directory and document paths that require being heavily escaped please. :ty:

From the README: ![[README]]

***
[zwat]: zettle is being used as the singular form of [zettlekasten](https://zettelkasten.de/overview/) (the [Wikipedia]() page) and if you haven't heard about something called #PKM or #zettelkasten this all might be really confusing for you. I should put something encouraging here.
