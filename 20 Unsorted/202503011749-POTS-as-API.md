# POTS as API

If you think of POTS telephone service and it's connected infrastructure as a signaling and messaging platform, then possible new uses for an untrustworthy environment that has been milked within an inch of it's life of revenue for what it was intended to be used for, it's possibly cheap enough to be useful for voice-enabled AI agents and applications.

## auth/authz and SS7

Nobody in my field will tell you SMS or telephone calls are suitable for private communication. There are systems like STIR/SHAKEN intended to make POTS calls more trustworthy and provide some assertion that a number that is presented via caller ID is an authentic call from the operator that 'owns' that number. But we're post-trust now, although I don't recommend accepting calls as a human or a machine from a call that has _not_ been authenticated. Check your call log, the incoming calls with a checkmark on them have been asserted as legitimate by the carrier. Anything else hasn't.

Notably my bank and nearby research hospital and credit union have spotty or non-existence implementations and most people outside of hacker circles don't know what STIR/SHAKEN is or what POTS means anyway.
